The package foo failed to build, here is a possible explanation why.

In this case, we are 90.69% certain of the response :slight_smile:.

 Based on the provided RPM build log snippets, it appears that during the build process, an error occurred resulting in a 404 Not Found error. The error message was displayed in an HTML format with various headers and body contents.

The first instance of the error message was detected in log snippet [3], where the title tag of an HTML document indicated a 404 Not Found error. Later in log snippet [5], the error message was displayed as an `<h1>` tag with the content "Not Found".

Log snippet [6] further clarified the error by stating that the requested URL was not found on the server. This typically indicates that a required file or resource was missing or could not be accessed at the specified location.

However, it is important to note that the log snippets do not provide information on the cause of the issue or potential solutions. It could be due to a missing or misconfigured file, a network issue, or a problem with the RPM build process itself.

To resolve the issue, it is recommended to first identify the cause of the missing file or resource. This can be done by checking the RPM source code and build files, as well as the configuration settings. If the issue is due to a network problem, then checking the network connectivity and firewall settings may be necessary. If the RPM build process is at fault, then consulting the RPM documentation and community may provide helpful insights.

Additionally, it may be helpful to review the RPM build logs in more detail to gain a better understanding of the build process and any errors that may have occurred. This can be done by using the 'rpm -ba --info' command to view detailed build information, or by using a log file viewer such as less or more to explore the log snippets in more detail.

<ul>

<li>
<b>Line 0:</b> <code><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet represents the beginning of an HTML document with the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML version 2.0, as defined by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). This declaration indicates that the following HTML code conforms to this version of the standard. It is a common practice for RPM to include this declaration at the beginning of the generated source RPM files to ensure consistent rendering of the HTML documentation.
</li>

<li>
<b>Line 2:</b> <code><html><head>
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet represents the output of two percentage signs (2%) indicating the progress of the build process. Following the percentage signs is the start tag of an HTML document (<html>) and the opening tag of the HTML head section (<head>). There is no indication of errors or issues in this log snippet.
</li>

<li>
<b>Line 3:</b> <code><title>404 Not Found</title>
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet indicates that during the build process, an error occurred resulting in a 404 Not Found error. The error message is displayed within an HTML title tag, specifically "<title>404 Not Found</title>". This error typically means that the required file or resource was not found or could not be accessed at the specified location.
</li>

<li>
<b>Line 4:</b> <code></head><body>
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet represents the output of the XML processing stage during the RPM build process. The snippet indicates that the XML header section has been successfully closed with '</head>', and the body section of the XML file is about to be processed with '<body>\n'. No errors or warnings have been reported in this log fragment.
</li>

<li>
<b>Line 5:</b> <code><h1>Not Found</h1>
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet indicates that an error occurred during the build process, specifically a "Not Found" error. The error message is displayed in an HTML format with an `<h1>` tag, signifying that it is a header in the HTML document. The content of the header is "Not Found". No further information is provided in the snippet regarding the cause or location of this error.
</li>

<li>
<b>Line 6:</b> <code><p>The requested URL was not found on this server.</p>
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet indicates that an error occurred during the build process when an attempted URL request was not found on the server. The message is displayed in an HTML format with a status code of 404, signifying a "Not Found" error. No further details about the cause of the issue or potential solutions are provided in this log snippet.
</li>

<li>
<b>Line 7:</b> <code></body></html>
</code>
 This RPM build log snippet represents the end of an HTML document being generated during the build process. The '<7' and '(7' at the beginning of the line are likely indicators of a hexadecimal number representing the byte order mark (BOM) for UTF-8 encoding. The following content, '</body></html>\n' is the standard closing tags for an HTML document's body and html elements. This indicates that the HTML document generation phase of the RPM build process has been completed.
