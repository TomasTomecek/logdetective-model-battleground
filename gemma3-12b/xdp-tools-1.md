The package foo failed to build, here is a possible explanation why.

Please know that the explanation was provided by AI and may be incorrect.
In this case, we are 87.42% certain of the response :neutral_face:.

The RPM build process failed due to the absence of several executables (`xdp-bench`, `xdp-forward`, `xdp-monitor`, `xdp-trafficgen`) within the `BUILDROOT/usr/bin` directory. This absence prevented the build from completing successfully, and ultimately caused the `systemd-nspawn` command within the mock build environment to fail. The root cause is likely a problem in the build process itselfâ€”the executables were either not built, or not copied to the intended location. The `systemd-nspawn` command attempts to build and test the package within a chroot environment, and the error occurred during that phase, indicating a failure in the build or installation stage within that environment.



To resolve this issue, investigate the build scripts (likely within the `xdp-tools.spec` file and associated build scripts) to ensure the executables are being correctly built and installed into the `BUILDROOT/usr/bin` directory. Check for any dependencies that might be missing, or steps that might be failing during the build process. It is also important to verify that the target architecture (aarch64) is correctly configured and supported by the build environment. A thorough review of the build scripts and environment configuration is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the missing executables.
