The package foo failed to build, here is a possible explanation why.

Please know that the explanation was provided by AI and may be incorrect.
In this case, we are 93.07% certain of the response :slight_smile:.

The build failed because essential executables (`xdp-bench`, `xdp-forward`, `xdp-monitor`, `xdp-trafficgen`) were not found in the expected location (`BUILDROOT/usr/bin`). This indicates that the build process didn't produce these executables or they weren't correctly placed in the build directory. This error occurred within a mock build environment using `systemd-nspawn`, which is used to isolate the build process.

The root cause likely lies within the `xdp-tools.spec` file or the build scripts invoked by it.  It's possible that a build step failed earlier, preventing the creation of these executables, or that the install step didn't copy them to the correct location within the build tree.

To resolve this, I recommend the following:

1.  **Examine the `xdp-tools.spec` file:** Carefully review the file for any errors in the build instructions, particularly the `install` section. Ensure the executables are being built and correctly placed in the `BUILDROOT/usr/bin` directory.
2.  **Inspect the build logs more closely:** While we have snippets, a full build log would be helpful to pinpoint the exact step where the executables were supposed to be created and why it failed.
3.  **Check for dependencies:** Verify that all dependencies required to build these executables are present and satisfied in the build environment.
4.  **Clean build:** Try a clean build by removing any existing build artifacts or using the `--noclean` option to force a full rebuild.
