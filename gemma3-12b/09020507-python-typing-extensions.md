The package foo failed to build, here is a possible explanation why.

Please know that the explanation was provided by AI and may be incorrect.
In this case, we are 86.72% certain of the response :neutral_face:.

The build of the `python-typing-extensions` package failed due to a series of test failures and an ultimately unsuccessful `%check` script execution within the RPM build process. The tests failing point to issues with the package's type hinting and related functionality, specifically related to how `TypedDict`s are handled and how annotations are processed. Several `AssertionError` exceptions were raised, indicating inconsistencies in the expected versus actual behavior during test execution, for example, the `test_stock_annotations`, `test_extra_items_class_arg`, `test_implicit_any_inheritance`, `test_regular_extra_items_legacy`, and `test_total` tests. These errors suggest potential bugs in the typing-extensions library itself, or incompatibilities with the testing environment.

The build process failed within a `systemd-nspawn` environment used by `mock` (a tool for automated package builds) during a Copr build. The ultimate failure was due to a non-zero exit code from the `%check` script, triggered by the test failures. The detailed test failures suggest that the library itself requires debugging, possibly related to the handling of type annotations and `TypedDict` objects.



To resolve this, the package maintainer should investigate the failing tests, identify the root cause of the assertion errors, and fix the corresponding code in the `typing_extensions` library. Once the code is corrected, a new build should be triggered to verify that the tests pass. It's possible a specific version of Python or related libraries in the build environment is causing issues, so that should also be investigated.
