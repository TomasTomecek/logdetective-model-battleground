The package foo failed to build, here is a possible explanation why.

Please know that the explanation was provided by AI and may be incorrect.
In this case, we are 91.98% certain of the response :slight_smile:.

The build process failed due to a complex series of dependencies and environment issues within a mock build environment. Here's a breakdown of the core problems and likely root causes, along with potential solutions:

**1. Core Issue: Systemd-Nspawn Failure & RPM Build within Chroot**

*   The primary error is the failure of `systemd-nspawn`, which is responsible for creating the chroot environment within which the RPM build takes place. The exit code of 127 indicates a command not found error within the chroot, specifically concerning the `rpmbuild` command itself.
*   This points to a problem with the environment setup inside the chroot.  The command `/usr/bin/rpmbuild` is likely not available or configured correctly within the chroot, preventing the RPM build from completing.

**2. Dependencies & Version Mismatches**

*   **LLVM Version Mismatch:** The initial error message indicates a symbol lookup error related to LLVM.  This suggests a dependency mismatch between the Rust compiler and the installed LLVM version within the build environment.  The build process probably attempts to use a specific LLVM version (LLVM\_20.1) that's not available or compatible.
*   **Rust Compiler Dependencies:** The LLVM error, in turn, affects the Rust compiler and its dependencies. A mismatch in these dependencies can lead to a cascade of errors.

**3. Environment Configuration Issues**

*   **Chroot Environment Setup:** The `systemd-nspawn` command sets up the chroot environment. There might be issues with the bind mounts, environment variables, and resolv configuration that prevent the correct setup of the chroot.
*   **Mock Build Environment:** The `mock` framework manages the build environment. Configuration issues within `mock` itself could cause problems with the chroot setup and the RPM build.
*   **Architecture Targeting (aarch64):** The build process targets the aarch64 architecture, which introduces additional complexity, especially if the build environment is not properly configured for that architecture.

**4. Mock Build Specific Errors**

*   The error originates within a mock build environment, implying that the problem likely stems from a misconfiguration or issue related to mock itself.

**Potential Solutions (Ordered by Priority)**

1.  **Fix the LLVM Dependency:**
    *   **Identify the Required LLVM Version:** Determine the specific LLVM version required by the Rust compiler and the build process.
    *   **Install the Correct LLVM Version:** Install the correct LLVM version within the build environment. If necessary, update the build environment's package repositories.
    *   **Configure Rust to Use the Correct LLVM:** Configure the Rust compiler to use the newly installed LLVM version.

2.  **Address the Systemd-Nspawn & Chroot Environment:**
    *   **Verify Bind Mounts:** Double-check the bind mounts used by `systemd-nspawn`. Ensure that the required directories and devices are correctly mounted within the chroot.
    *   **Ensure RPM Build Availability:** Ensure that the `/usr/bin/rpmbuild` command is available and configured correctly within the chroot environment.
    *   **Check Environment Variables:** Verify that the environment variables are correctly set up within the chroot. Pay attention to variables like `PATH`, `TERM`, `SHELL`, and `LANG`.
    *   **Inspect `/etc/resolv.conf`:** Verify that the `/etc/resolv.conf` file is correctly configured within the chroot, especially if DNS resolution is required.

3.  **Review and Correct Mock Build Configuration:**
    *   **Examine Mock Configuration Files:** Review the mock configuration files to ensure they are correctly set up.
    *   **Update Mock Cache:** Update the mock cache to ensure that the latest packages and dependencies are available.
    *   **Clean Mock Build Directory:** Clean the mock build directory to remove any old or corrupted files.

4.  **Address Architecture Targeting:**
    *   **Verify aarch64 Build Environment:** Ensure that the build environment is properly configured for the aarch64 architecture. This may involve installing the appropriate cross-compilation tools and libraries.
    *   **Confirm Architecture Compatibility:** Confirm that the `rust-fd-find.spec` file is correctly configured for the aarch64 architecture.

5.  **Simplify Build Steps (as a debugging step):**
    *   **Reduce Bind Mounts:** Temporarily reduce the number of bind mounts used by `systemd-nspawn` to simplify the chroot environment and isolate the problem.
    *   **Simplify Environment Variables:** Temporarily reduce the number of environment variables set by `systemd-nspawn`.



**Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Verbose Mock Build:** Run the mock build with verbose output to get more detailed information about the build process.
2.  **Inspect Chroot Environment:**  After the `systemd-nspawn` command fails, manually inspect the chroot environment to see what's going wrong.
3.  **Run Commands Manually:** Try running the commands that are failing manually within the chroot environment to isolate the problem.



To help me further diagnose this issue, please provide the following information:

*   **`rust-fd-find.spec` File Contents:** The contents of the `rust-fd-find.spec` file.
*   **Mock Configuration:** The contents of any mock configuration files.
*   **Build Environment Details:** Details about the build environment, including the operating system version, LLVM version, and Rust compiler version.
*   **Complete Mock Build Logs:** The complete mock build logs, including any error messages.

The RPM build log snippet indicates a `mockbuild.exception.Error` occurred during a mock build process. The error originated from a failed `systemd-nspawn` command. The command was intended to create and run a chroot environment for building, using `/var/lib/mock/eln-build-side-110864-59163989-6571396/root` as the root directory. The command attempted to bind multiple device nodes and directories, set environment variables (TERM, SHELL, HOME, HOSTNAME, PATH, PROMPT_COMMAND, PS1, LANG), disable resolv.conf, and execute `/usr/bin/rpmbuild -ba --noprep --noclean --target aarch64 /builddir/build/SPECS/rust-fd-find.spec` within the chroot. The exit code of the `systemd-nspawn` command was 127.
